You see I'm searching for a real love
And I don't know where to go
I been around the world and high and low
And still I'll never know
How it feels to have a real love
'Cause it seems there's none around
Gotta end it in this way because
Seems he can't be
We are lovers true and through
And though we made it through the storm
I really want you to realize
I really want to put you on
I've been searchin' for someone
To satisfy my every need
Won't you be my inspiration
Be the real love that I need?
Real love
I'm searchin' for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love
I'm searchin' for a real love
Ooh, when I met you I just knew
That you would take my heart and run
Until you told me how you felt for me
You said I'm not the one
So I slowly came to see
All of the things that you were made of
And now I hope my dreams and inspirations
Lead me to want some real love
Real love
I'm searchin' for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love
I'm searchin' for a real love
I got to have a real love
Love's so true and oh baby
I thought that love was you
I thought you were the answer to
The questions in my mind
But it seems that I was wrong
If I stay strong maybe
I'll find my real love
Look up in the sky it's a bird, it's a plane
Nope, it's Mary J
ain't a damn thing changed
Kickin' ill flava with the Teflon Don
Record shop getting props
She got it goin' on
So what's it gonna be?
The real one, the fake one
Ya need a minute to think for whom ya better take
What up? My time is up
Peace out to Brooklyn
Helpin' daddy-o ay yo, bring the verse in
So I try my best and pray to God
He'll send me someone real
To caress me and to guide me towards
A love my heart can feel
Now I know I can be faithful
I can be your all in all
I'll give you good lovin' through the summertime
Winter, spring, and fall
Real love
I'm searchin' for a real love
Someone to set my heart free (real love)
Real love
I'm searchin' for a real love
You see I'm searching for a real love
And I don't know where to go
I been around the world and high and low
And still I'll never know
How it feels to have a real love
'Cause it seems there's none around
Gotta end it in this way because
Seems he can't be found
Real love
I'm searchin' for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love
I'm searchin' for a real love
Real love
I'm searchin' for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love
I'm searchin' for a real love
Real love
I'm searchin' for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love
I'm searchin' for a real love
Real love
